dotfiles
========

Dotfiles is an idea to manage the config files use git and ln.
Everyone has its own favors to set his system and tools, those settings may be stored
in special files, those files is called dotfiles.
What is a problem is that, those files live everywhere in the system, and too many that 
you can not find them(you may forget its name, hih).
The main idea is that you can store the real config file to your folder and place a hard
link to its real place, then you can share or manage it use github or other.
An autogen tool may needs to collect the dotfiles and deploy them.
this may be useful to the system tools, the tools that you install yourself may be placed to diffrent places and autogen may be not so useful.
